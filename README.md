Sonar Data Classification
This project implements a logistic regression model to classify sonar signals as either a rock or a mine.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset. It contains 60 numerical features representing the energy of the sonar signal at different frequencies, and a target variable indicating whether the object is a rock ('R') or a mine ('M').

Project Structure
The notebook contains the following sections:

Data Collection and Processing: Loading and inspecting the dataset.
Data Preparation: Separating features and target, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training a logistic regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the accuracy of the model on both training and testing data.
Predictive System: Demonstrating how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
